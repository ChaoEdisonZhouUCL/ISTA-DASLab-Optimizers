# ISTA DAS Lab Optimization Algorithms Package
This repository contains optimization algorithms for Deep Learning developed by 
the Distributed Algorithms and Systems lab at Institute of Science and Technology Austria.

### Installation
We provide a script `install.sh` that creates a new environment, installs requirements 
and then builds the optimizers project. We use `python3 setup.py install` because we are 
currently facing issues with installing the extension as a PyPi package, but this will be
fixed as soon as possible.
```
bash install.sh
```
